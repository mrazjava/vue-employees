# Employee Listing

A trivial (but very useful) [tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/) about `vue.js`. This is 
example of my self-induced exposure to the front-end in general and curiousity about `vue` in particular. As I spend 
95% of my coding time on the backend I don't normally get a change to do any front end work, let alone implementing 
usable features, so this little project allows me to do this.

This was a more-less step by step implementation of Tania's tutorial (which is evident from `git log`) with some 
additions of my own.

In the future (and as time permits) I may implement a usable full-stack project based on vue.js (frontend), REST and 
java (backend).
