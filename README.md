# Employee Listing

A trivial (but very useful) [tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/) about `vue.js`.

This is example of my self-induced exposure to the front-end in general and curiosity about `vue` in particular. As I 
spend vast majority of my coding time on the backend, I usually don't get a chance to do any front end work, let alone 
implementing usability features. This little project allowed me to do this.

This was a more-less step by step implementation of Tania's tutorial (which is evident from `git log`) with some 
additions of my own. In the future (update: see [booklink](https://github.com/mrazjava/booklink)) I may implement a 
usable full-stack project based on vue.js (frontend), REST and java (backend).
